# Development Principles

- DRY
- Automate standards
  - linting
  - utils to check things on CI
- Explore the problem before suggesting solutions
  - Don't look for solutions immediately, start by discussing the problem in more detail first
- Hypotheses -> build -> measure -> learn
- Move all communication to a single platform
- Build for now, not for later
- Choose your tools and be prepared to stick with them and those versions forever
- Can a comment blind person read your code
- The user-facing frontend is more important than the backend
- Youâ€™re building for an actual person, not an engineer
