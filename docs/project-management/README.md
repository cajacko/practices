<!-- # Project Management

## Trello setup

For each project have the following boards and columns

- User Stories
  - Description: This is a board where each card is a separate user story. You can have any columns
    you want in here, but we suggested the following below.
  - Columns (Suggested):
  - Card contents
    -
- Backlog
- Active

## Notes TODO: Remove

Don't do anything without an implemented scenario to test against
No scenario without a user story .feature file
No .feature file without an associated active Issue
No active

---

- No dev work without an implemented scenario that fails for the new work
- Do not do any more dev work than necessary to pass the scenario and our other tests
- Every scenario must have a tag for the ticket creating it
- Every ticket needs to reference the user story it relates to (or be a user story)
- No scenario can reference a ticket without an estimate
- No feature file without a user story
- No feature file without a tag the the user story ticket

---

2 types of cards

- User Story
- Task

User Story can have multiple tasks or none. User Story also counts as a Task if it has no Tasks underneath it

User Story must reference something on the Business Model Canvas for the project?

Can't mark a task as complete unless a rough completion time is put against it

---

Columns in Trello/Jira
Separate board for dicking about and having ideas and prioritising them. Another one for what actually doing. Every task on there must be no more than a 1 day task

---

User Stories (epics) - Have a separate board for these and track their progress separately?
Tasks

3 boards

- User Stories - Can be grouped however you like
- Backlog - Can be grouped however you like
- Sprint - Backlog, Failed QA, In Progress, In QA, Done
