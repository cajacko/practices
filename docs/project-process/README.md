# Project Process

Whenever you start to work on a project follow this process and repeat:

- `if (`[**The project canvas, hypotheses, user stories or tasks need refining now**](#waaa)`)`
  - Refine them (See checklist ...)
- `else if (`**If there is at least 1 task in "Repeated Tasks" that should be done now over anything in "In Progress", "Failed QA" or "Backlog"**`)`
  - Do the highest priority one (See checklist moving from "Repeated Tasks" to "In Progress")
- `else if (`**There is a task assigned to you in "In progress"**`)`
  - Do it
- `else if (`**There is at least 1 task assigned to you in "Failed QA"**`)`
  - Do the highest priority one (See checklist moving from failed QA to in progress)
- `else if (`**There is a task in "Backlog" that you can assign to yourself**`)`
  - Do it (See checklist moving from backlog to in progress)
- `else`
  - Congratulations there is currently nothing for you to do!
  - If this is a mistake it means the refinement didn't happen properly
